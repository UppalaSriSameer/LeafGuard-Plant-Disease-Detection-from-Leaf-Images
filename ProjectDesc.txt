LeafGuard: Plant Disease Detection from Leaf Images
Difficulty level: Medium

This is one of the unique data science project ideas for beginners, where you use an application with deep-learning models to identify plant diseases depending on their leaf images. Farmers often face difficulty in crop management and preventing yield loss. 

This LeafGuard application uses convolutional neural networks to analyze leaf images, identification patterns, and visual cues related to different plant diseases. This can aid farmers in monitoring their crops’ health and implementing timely precautions. 

Learning outcomes:

The use of multiple techniques for image enhancement and preprocessing to enhance the ability of the model to identify subtle disease symptoms 
Design a CNN or convolutional neural network architecture with high sensitivity and specificity to recognize and detect plant diseases 
Improve model features to classify images into different disease classes, providing a better understanding of plant health
Gain experience with model training evaluation and optimization 
Understand how to handle imbalanced data sets and class imbalance
What it takes to execute this project: 

Use PlantVillage data set that contains images of different plant diseases and healthy conditions labeled with plant disease categories
Preprocess the images, including resizing, normalization, and data augmentation
Split the dataset into training, validation, and test sets
Design and implement deep learning models for image classification, including CNNs and transfer learning
Train the models on the training data and evaluate their performance on the validation set
Optimize the model’s architecture, hyperparameters, and training strategies
Evaluate the final model on the unseen test set and analyze the results
Visualize and interpret the model’s predictions and decision-making process
Real-life applications:

Farmers can use this for early detection and monitoring of plant diseases
Agricultural companies can deploy such an application for yield prediction and making data-driven crop management strategies
The government can use this application to advise farmers on what measures they should take beforehand to prevent yield loss
